# Example Rails 8 Bootstrap remote modals app

A minimal example of a Rails 8 app with modal forms, with Bootstrap for CSS,
Postgresql as the database, Hotwire as the JavaScript framework and Propshaft
as the asset pipeline.  The important parts are the modals, based on 
[Benito Serna's article](https://bhserna.com/remote-modals-with-rails-hotwire-and-bootstrap.html)
and the configuration of Bootstrap with Rails 8.  The main steps used to create this app
are shown in [README-create.md](https://github.com/jlm/r8-bs-remote-modals-example/blob/main/README-create.md).  

Tool versions

* Ruby 3.4.7
* Rails 8.1.1
